We believe that the foundation of great cooking starts with the best ingredients. That's why we are committed to providing our customers with all the essentials (Grocery ) that not only meets but exceeds your expectations. Our brand Anajwala, is a pioneer brand of grains made to provide quality and nutritious grain flour to the nation. Due to the time crunch in today's fast paced world, vision like that of our brand is needed. This idea not only meets the basic nutritional needs of consumers but also wipes out regular time consuming visits to grain store. This innovative idea promotes ‘hyper fresh concept’ as it promises to deliver the desired flour within 24 hours. Varieties of fresh flour like wheat flour and multi grain are provided. We also plan to add more varieties of flour in the future. To cater to the needs of diverse classes our wheat flour has 3 different types (based on quality) which are - 'Silver' 'Gold' and 'Platinum' Eradicating adulteration from the food is the need of the hour as many diseases sprout from the adulterants. Addition of dyes such as sudan dyes for coloring or melamine for increasing protein content can pose big risks to human health. A section of consumers aware of the adulteration in flour switched to the packaged food and as observed from the research studies, preservatives present in packaged food is one of the causes of cancer. Our brand fulfills the preservative free flour requirement of the consumers. Anajwala also realises its social responsibility towards society and in order to fulfill a social duty, we take up the initiative to reconnect the abandoned people with society by making them a part of our business. Their participation in advertising and propagating our concept among masses would ensure their economic self reliance. It would supply them with a purpose, dignity and confidence to tackle challenges head-on thrown at them by life.",
